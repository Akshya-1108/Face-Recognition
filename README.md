# Face-Recognition
This project uses OpenCV's built-in deep learning methods for real-time face recognition from video streams or images. It detects and identifies multiple faces by comparing them to a dataset of known faces. Simple to set up and run, just add known faces to the dataset, and the script will recognize and label faces in real-time.
